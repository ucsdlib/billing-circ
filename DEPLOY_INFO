1)You can either scp the file to your home dir on thalos/duilwen, and then sudo to tomcat and copy the file.

2)Or you can sudo to tomcat, checkout svn://pelennor.ucsd.edu/pub/data2/svn/trunk/common/jboss/dev/, and the copy the file

3)NOTE:Subversion does not support checkout of a single file, it only supports checkout of directory structures.
However, you can use 'svn export' to export a single file. 
This will retrieve the file's contents, it just won't create a versioned working copy.
